## About Binary Trees

A binary tree is a type of hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. Binary trees are widely used in computer science and form the basis for various tree-based algorithms and data structures.

Understanding binary trees is essential for developing efficient solutions to problems involving data organization, searching, sorting, and more.
